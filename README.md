# Real-time-face-recognition-using-OpenCV
This project utilizes OpenCV Library in Python to make a Real-Time Face Detection using our webcam as a primary camera.It is capable of identifying or verifying a person from a video frame. This project also uses K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm to detect a face from a given set of faces.
